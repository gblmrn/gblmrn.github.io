      <description>After a lot of typing my wrist started to hurt. So I done some research and found out that the best way to have you hand when typing is without resting your palms on you keyboard, basically keep your elbows up like a piano player&amp;hellip;because in the long run can cause fatigue and also other wrist problems. After testing this method I am quite happy with the result and I will try to implement it more and more &amp;#x1f603;.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a great minimalistic tool for generating static websites. It took me one day to get a hang of it and be able to generate and publish my own website. Also the fact that there are a lot of themes at your fingertips is great, because you can also switch your aspect of your site without much effort.</description>
